# My2DGame
Yeah the name is just My2DGame, cause i don't know to call it.  
This was a university project.

The game is a generic tile-based RPG written from scratch in Java.  
It doesn't use any pre-built game engine.  
I've also developed a custom *level* format to write new levels.  
It just misses an editor.
Down here you can see a demo of the game.

Game also supports pad input using XInput.  
If you wanna give it a try clone this repo and:

```console
$ ./gradlew jar
```

And run the generated jar under */build/libs*.  
Code it's a good starting point to understand game engines, even if this one is really simple, and also, it teaches you how not to use inheritance. ;)
